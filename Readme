Motive

According to various studies, business experts have agreed that the world needs to support the development of women entrepreneurs. 
It also emphasises on economic freedom of women.Entrepreneurship will help women to get economic freedom which in turn 
uplifts their social status in the society. A strong woman means a strong economy and a strong society.
My motive is to build a strong society by making women strong. Economic freedom through entrepreneurship is the concept. 
Provide one-stop solution to women for entrepreneurship to gain economic freedom. Address all the major challenges faced by
women while starting new business.When the campaign is over I would actually like to make this project live by 
onboarding more and more women entrepreneurs.
